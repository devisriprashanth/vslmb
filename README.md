- The demands of essential legal assistance from clients remain challenging due to problems with finding qualified legal assistance providers. The paper focuses on a web-based "Smart Advocate Finding and Booking System" which simplifies the complete advocate search and hiring operations. Three web technologies collude to enable the system's operation through React together with Express for backend services and MySQL for data storage. The application provides functionality that allows identity verification for users with advocate profile access and feedback systems alongside continuous booking options. The application enhances accessibility along with legal services efficiency through its search technology with the additional filtering feature. The system functions smoothly and securely because it uses JWT-based authentication and robust database management protocols. The system meets its purpose to simplify legal service access as demonstrated through testing of its functional elements. Users benefit from improved experience when AI recommendation programs and safe payment gateway systems integrate in the future.
